### Day 4: April 27, 2018

**Today's Progress** Go Army Carousel & Code Repository 

**Thoughts:** Made more progress on the carousel but I cannot get the right scroll effect yet.  I'm also creating a code repository with useful SharePoint code snippets to assist Knowledge Systems Engineers at work.

### Day 3: April 26, 2018

**Today's Progress** Volunteer work for a local women's support group & hacking a jCarousel from the GoArmy official webpage.  

**Thoughts:** Unfortunately, I was not able to study my Udacity course today but I was able to get the ground work of two new projects started.  I forked a nice layout for the women's group from [TechNext](https://github.com/technext/labs).  Can't wait to get the website up and running.

<!--### Day 3: November 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: The FreeCodeCamp JavaScript module is dooooonnnneee!  Moving on to Object Oriented and Functional Programming next. Broke my "Hello World" webpart to better understand how SharePoint works with React. Started reviewing SQL Database Fundamentals on the Microsoft Virtual Academy.

**Thoughts:** Feeling pretty good about completing the JavaScript but I still have a lot to learn and topics to review as a refresher.

**Training** [MVA SQL Fundamentals](https://mva.microsoft.com/en-US/training-courses/sql-database-fundamentals-16944?l=w7qq6nAID_6805121157)

### Day 4: November 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed LeanKit Kanban tutorial and brushed up on SCRUM. Reviewed more of the SharePoint Framework and broke my "Hello World" web part for fun. 

**Thoughts:** Started my new job as a SharePoint Developer today.  My PM asked about REST APIs and I'm so glad I was able to answer his question based on studying the day before. 

**Training:** [LeanKit Tutorial](https://support.leankit.com/hc/en-us/articles/204413443-Lesson-1-How-LeanKit-Works-The-Concept)

### Day 5: November 21, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed FreeCodeCamp excercises on Object Oriented and Functional Programming and started Basic Algorithm Scripting.  Also reviewed Microsoft InfoPath Forms Services.

**Thoughts** The algorithm scripting excercises were challenging but rewarding after I completed a few -- very time consuming.  Researched InfoPath Form Services and quickly learned that Microsoft is no longer continuing development but will support the program until 2023.  The Microsoft Ignite conference in September, recommended using PowerApps as a replacement.

**Work:**
1. [Reverse A String](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/reverse-a-string)
2. [Factorialize a Number](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/factorialize-a-number)

**Training:** 
1. [Microsoft InfoPath](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Find-content-about-InfoPath-2010-and-2013-A7BDD91D-02B4-4596-A22A-2BAD4DE69835#__toc349315878)
