<!--### Day 2: November 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed more FreeCodeCamp JavaScript module...alomost done! Read more on SharePoint REST APIs and played in code with CRUD.

**Thoughts:** This is quite a long module, estimated to take 10 hours to complete.  The SharePoint CRUD process will more than likely be used frequently in my new job.

### Day 3: November 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: The FreeCodeCamp JavaScript module is dooooonnnneee!  Moving on to Object Oriented and Functional Programming next. Broke my "Hello World" webpart to better understand how SharePoint works with React. Started reviewing SQL Database Fundamentals on the Microsoft Virtual Academy.

**Thoughts:** Feeling pretty good about completing the JavaScript but I still have a lot to learn and topics to review as a refresher.

### Day 4: November 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed LeanKit Kanban tutorial and brushed up on SCRUM. Reviewed more of the SharePoint Framework and broke my "Hello World" web part for fun. 

**Thoughts:** Started my new job as a SharePoint Developer today.  My PM asked about REST APIs and I'm so glad I was able to answer his question based on studying the day before.

### Day 5: November 21, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed FreeCodeCamp excercises on Object Oriented and Functional Programming and started Basic Algorithm Scripting.  Also reviewed Microsoft InfoPath Forms Services.

**Thoughts** The algorithm scripting excercises were challenging but rewarding after I completed a few -- very time consuming.  Researched InfoPath Form Services and quickly learned that Microsoft is no longer continuing development but will support the program until 2023.  The Microsoft Ignite conference in September, recommended using PowerApps as a replacement.
