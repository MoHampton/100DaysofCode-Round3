# 100DaysofCode-Round3

# What is Mo learning now?? 
In Round 3 of 100 Day of Code, I will focus on completing the Udacity Front End Developer Nanodegree.  I was fortunate to earn a Grow with Google Scholarship!  This is an exciting opportunity - I see many late nights and early morning coding sessions in my near future.

This repo was built to track my daily learning and acts as an accountability tool for the [#100DaysofCode](https://twitter.com/hashtag/100DaysOfCode?src=hash) Twitter challenge.
